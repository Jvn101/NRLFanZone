## Project Description

We saw the opportunity to create a NRL FanZone application for NRL fans across the country to connect. Users register in the members area of the webiste to get exclusive access to the list of NRL teams and fan post discussions. All registered users can click onto a team and write a post to discuss whatever is on their mind with fellow fans
